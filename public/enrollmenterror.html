        <div id="introduction">
            The Beaverton School District (BSD) enrollement forecast, used to determine high school boundaries,
            predicts student enrollement 6 years in the future based on current enrollement, new construction,
            and the probability of student progression. The error analysis performed below and supplied to BSD
            applies BSD's own forecast method to historic BSD enrollement data in order to determine the error of
            the BSD enrollement forecast. Because of this error analysis, BSD admitted that they accidentally
            double counted option school students and did not take the time to consider enrollement trends within
            the district (<a href="https://v3.boardbook.org/Public/PublicItemDownload.aspx?ik=39121399">

            </a>). In
            addition, rather than addressing these errors, the BSD simply hopes that these errors will provide
            a buffer of additional space. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Westview's growth--the motivation
            for the new high school and subsequent boundary adjustment process--is significantly higher than the
            BSD enrollement forecast while all other schools' growth is significantly less. Consequently, although
            the BSD is unnecessarily displacing 40% of the school district, it has publicly recognized that much
            of this displacement is unnecessary. Still worse, based on its own data and forecast, the BSD has
            seen that the proposed boundaries will still not solve the original problem of Westview's enrollement growth.

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>Option School Error:</b> if computed correctly, the student
                            <a href="http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1411&context=jmasm">
                                progression probability
                            </a> would have included the probability
                            of students transitions between comprehensive schools and option schools.
                            Unfortunately, option school students were simply subtracted from the initial data set.  The 6 year
                            progression means freshman, sophomore, and junior option school students are double counted
                            (about 1040 students or 10% of high school enrollement). In an attempt to correct this error, the BSD
                            <a href="https://v3.boardbook.org/Public/PublicItemDownload.aspx?ik=39121399">

                            </a> incorrectly subtracted the senior option school student count from the high school enrollement although
                            this number had already been subtracted from the 6th grade enrollement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Error in Growth Rate:</b> the growing enrollement error (~2%/year) is clearly visible
                            by plotting "Beaverton SD 48J" in the "Forecast Error Analysis" graph.  In a 6 year forecst, the
                            error in growth rate is even greater than the option school error--12%  or 1200 student over
                            prediction--by 2020.  The error in growth rate is in addition to the option school error.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Neighborhood Differences in Student Progression:</b> the largest error in the BSD enrollement forecast
                            is the assumption that student progression is constant throughout the district.  Plotting the forecast
                            error for individual high schools clearly shows the flaw in this assumption.  Westview, for example,
                            under predicts student enrollement by 5% while all other high schools over predict student enrollement by up to
                            18% for 2015.  This is despite taking into account the differences in new construction across BSD.
                            Clearly, student progression is not constant across the school district.  The excuse for not accounting for
                            the largest error source in the enrollement forecast is the time needed to reformat historic student data.
                            The time to reformat historic student data is certainly less than the time, expense
                            and disruption caused to the district by ignoring these errors.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    The massive BSD enrollement forecast errors clearly show the forecast is unable to predict future enrollement.
                    This is the first BSD enrollement forecast produced by Davis Demographics software.  Obviously, its results should
                    have been checked against historic enrollement data and previous forecasts.  This was not done effectively.
                    With total error for different high school schools both over and under predicting 2020 enrollement
                    by 30% or more, no confidence or valid conclusions can be made based on the currentbBSD enrollement forecast.
                    <br /><br />
                    The boundary proposal provided by Superintendent Rose <a href="http://www.sensibleboundaries.com/analysis/">
                    violates both the <a href="https://www.beaverton.k12.or.us/dist/Admin%20Regs%20and%20Policies/JC.pdf">
                    desires and process</a> established by the school board.  Since it also fails to feasibly allocate
                    high school space in its rush redefine high school boundaries, none of the high school boundary objectives
                    have been satisfied.
                    <br /><br />
                    For Superintendent Grotting, restarting the high school boundary ajustment process with a verified enrollment
                    forecast is the best possible scenario.  Because elementary and middle school
                    boundary changes are still ahead, all school boundaries can be adderssed together with much better results.
                    All school boundaries require an accurate enrollment forecast.
                    BSD now recognizes that there will be fewer students than was previously forecast.  The resulting surplus space can be
                    directed, not for arbitrary and unnecessary boundary changes due to massive forecast errors, but at improving the
                    quality of our children’s education.  School board members and BSD have previoiusly advocated new science,
                    technology, and vocational programs that now become possible.
